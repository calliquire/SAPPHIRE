# Fitting Mixed-Effects Model

For this analysis, I am only running the PCA on the screening_long.csv dataset for practice. This analysis focuses on the simplified version of the model, where we include key factors like collection_period, body_site, and reflectance_type while accounting for participant-level variability.

## Set Up

1. Install the relevant packages.

```{r}
install.packages("lme4")
install.packages("reshape2")
```

2. Load the relevant packages.
```{r}
library(lme4)
library(reshape2)
```

3. Load the screening data.
```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/screening_long.csv")
```
